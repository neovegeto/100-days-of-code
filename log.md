##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)

### Day 2: June 7, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I have watched more Videos from the path for 'Data Analysis with Python' on FreeCodeCamp. I'm finished with Numpy and Panda.
Now I will come to **"Data Cleaning"**

**Thoughts** There are a lot of videos, but unfortunately there is not much training.
Tomorrow i will have a look at the exercises, they provide.
I found this exercises today.

At some point, I have to find out, what kind of language we use here, so I can hide the examples.

### Day 3: June 8, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I did several exercises from [https://www.freecodecamp.org/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and their GitHup.
It was not this difficult. So I read additional material on [https://www.learnpython.org/](https://www.learnpython.org/).

I also looked up, which kind of langugage we are using here.
According to my research it should be [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

I also figured out how to comment out the first day, according to this [website](https://gist.github.com/jonikarppinen/47dc8c1d7ab7e911f4c9).
We will if it worked.

`As answers to this Stack Overflow question reveal, using <!--- and ---> or <!-- and --> works (view source by clicking "Raw"):`

**Thoughts** I need to find better training options. Maybe I should
hang out in Codewars or check other **100 Days of Coding**-Blogs.

### Day 4: June 11, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I watched a bunch of videos for the statistic part of Data Analysis.
The recommended YouTube channel was [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/c/joshstarmer).
I've also read lectures on the [https://www.learnpython.org/](https://www.learnpython.org/).

**Thoughts** I'm watching a lot of videos. I should also focus on practical knowledge.

**Today's Progress**: I looked in my book collection and I found nice practical book
for my first steps in Data Analysis. In the book [Python Crash Course](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/)

**Thoughts** I will work on this tomorrow
